# Design contribution guidelines

A collection of design contribution guidelines and resources for react-avatar-editor.

> **All participating designers are highly encouraged to shape and evolve these guidelines!**

## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome

We're glad you're looking to help us improve the end user facing parts of this tiny little plugin. 
You might have seen it already in action in thousands of places where you upload and modify your profile image.

You can find a quick demo of it in action: https://react-avatar-editor.netlify.app

## ðŸš¢ How to contribute design

1. Check out open [issues](https://github.com/mosch/react-avatar-editor
/issues) here on GitHub (we label them with `design: ðŸ’…required`)
2. Feel free to open an issue on your own if you find something you would like to contribute to the project and use the `design: ðŸ’¡idea` label for it.
3. We do not have any design files in place yet so feel free to create new ones and share them publicly
4. Add your contributions to an issue and we promise we will review your contribution carefully and foster discussions


## ðŸŽ­ Target audience

Our target audience is 100% React developers who are using this component. But the design choices made might unfluence the end user who is interacting with the Avatar editor drastically.

## ðŸ’… Design relevant materials

As mentioned above â€“ we do not have any design related materials (Logo, Figma mocks, etc) yet. Feel free to add them to this document as things evolve.

You can look at our demo here to get a clue of how it currently looks like:
